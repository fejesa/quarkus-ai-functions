            Use this tool to obtain the full address of the ORIGINAL query person.
            Input: a Person object containing:
            - firstName (non-null, non-empty, exact from input)
            - lastName (non-null, non-empty, exact from input)
            - birthDate (non-null, non-empty, exact from input)

               {
                 "country": "<string>",

            RULES:
             - If `searchUser` returns SIMILARMATCH, you are REQUIRED to call this tool exactly once.
             - Skipping this tool call in a SIMILARMATCH flow is a violation of the rules.
             - Final output MUST NOT be produced until after this tool is called and its result is used in similarity checks.
             - NEVER call this tool for candidate users â€” their addresses come directly from the search results.
             - The returned address is called 'original' and will be used as the baseline for similarity checks.
             - The Person input to this tool MUST NEVER be null, empty, or substituted.
             - Passing null is a violation of the rules.
