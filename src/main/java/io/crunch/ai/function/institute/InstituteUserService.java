/**
 * Service responsible for retrieving and validating institute user information.
 * <p>
 * This class integrates with the LangChain4j tool system, exposing a tool
 * ({@link #getUserAddress(Person)}) that provides the original query person's
 * full {@link Address} for similarity-based matching flows.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Key Responsibilities</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Expose the {@code getUserAddress} tool for retrieving the original person's address.</li>
 *   <li>Enforce business rules regarding when and how this tool should be invoked in similarity match flows.</li>
 *   <li>Provide validation methods to check if a given person exists in the institute's records.</li>
 *   <li>Encapsulate the retrieval logic of {@link InstituteUser} entities from the persistence layer.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>LangChain4j Integration</h2>
 * The {@code getUserAddress} method is annotated as a {@link Tool}, making it available
 * to the model during reasoning. It is strictly used to retrieve the "original" user's address
 * and must <strong>never</strong> be used for candidate users.
 *
 * <h2>Rules Enforced in the Tool</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>If a {@code SIMILARMATCH} result is returned, this tool <strong>must</strong> be called exactly once.</li>
 *   <li>The final output must not be generated until this tool has been invoked and its result
 *       integrated into similarity comparisons.</li>
 *   <li>Candidate user addresses are never retrieved through this tool; they come directly from the search results.</li>
 *   <li>The input {@link Person} must not be {@code null} or empty.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Transactional Behavior</h2>
 * The {@code getUserAddress} method is transactional and ensures database operations are
 * executed within a transaction boundary. By default, it is not necessary to annotate, but some test scenarios require it.
 *
 * @see Person
 * @see Address
 * @see InstituteUser

            Use this tool to obtain the full address of the ORIGINAL query person.
            Input: a Person object containing:
            - firstName (non-null, non-empty, exact from input)
            - lastName (non-null, non-empty, exact from input)
            - birthDate (non-null, non-empty, exact from input)

            RULES:
             - If `searchUser` returns SIMILARMATCH, you are REQUIRED to call this tool exactly once.
             - Skipping this tool call in a SIMILARMATCH flow is a violation of the rules.
             - Final output MUST NOT be produced until after this tool is called and its result is used in similarity checks.
             - NEVER call this tool for candidate users â€” their addresses come directly from the search results.
             - The returned address is called 'original' and will be used as the baseline for similarity checks.
             - The Person input to this tool MUST NEVER be null, empty, or substituted.
             - Passing null is a violation of the rules.
